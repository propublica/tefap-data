We’re attaching the data the USDA gave us. The records show **4,304 canceled deliveries** between May and September across the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and D.C. Each row represents one of those orders.

### Column Descriptions
From the USDA response to our FOIA, with our notes/added columns in **purple**:

- **Column A**: A unique ID for each type of item.
- **Column B**: Description of the items
- **Column C**: Number of cases ordered by the food bank.
- **Column E**: Delivery status — `order received`, `cancelled`, or `purchased`.
  - *“Purchased” applies to items that were ordered, but not delivered at the date the FOIA was completed (7/29/2025).*
- **Column F and G**: Requested delivery date and actual delivery date.
  - If the items weren’t delivered, the actual delivery date will be blank.
